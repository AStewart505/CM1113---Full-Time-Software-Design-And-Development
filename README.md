The Three Blind Men

Statement of individual Contribution: Andrew Stewart(2316979)
I was responsible for implementing the species subclass and it's various subclasses. This involved defing the various methods of each class and ensureing the inheritance from the given superclass worked correctley. I also added the uder input aspect to allow the player to choose thier Proffession and species and then to dicide on any further specilisations or variants. I included a loop to allow thing to run smoothly and output statements to display the user's choice.

I was responsible implementing the proffesion subclass and its various subclasses. This involved making sure that all subclasses and superclasses worked together while looking out for errors when putting it together with the other code. i also worked on the testing segment and made sure the code worked to standard. i was away in a different country during most of our working process so i was unable to use github and upload during that time. 

Statement of Compliance: Andrew Stewart(2316979) I created the species and it's relevant subclasses. I used many of the methods and practices shown in the labs and the lectures. I also looked on W3 Schools for some clarification on topics like enums and inheritance.

Statement of Compliance: Gregor MacLeod(2303200) I worked on the proffesions and its relevant subclasses. i used methods and practices shown in the labs and the lectures. I also used w3schools and stack overflow to better understand how to implement and make sure theres less errors. I also used world of warcraft and similar games as a reference for the names of the proffesions.
