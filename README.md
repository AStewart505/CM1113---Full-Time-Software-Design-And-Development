Statement of individual Contribution: Andrew Stewart(2316979)
I was responsible for implementing the species subclass and it's various subclasses. This involved defing the various methods of each class and ensureing the inheritance from the given superclass worked correctley. I also added the uder input aspect to allow the player to choose thier Proffession and species and then to dicide on any further specilisations or variants. I included a loop to allow thing to run smoothly and output statements to display the user's choice.

Statement of Compliance: Andrew Stewart(2316979) I created the spceies and it's relevant subclasses. I used many of the methods and practices shown in the labs and the lectures. I also looked on W3 Schools for some clarification on topics like enums and inheritance.
